Uni Hub Education

**Problem Statement:**

Nowadays, there is a great need of an information portal by means of which , one
can get acquainted with the information about the educational institutions in the
most simplifed manner. As we are all aware that there is an availability of an
extremely huge amount of information that one can access over the Internet. But, a
more concise and efcient methodology would be signifcantly efcient to analyze.

**Solution Description:**

Ours is a model which provides the user to easily and efciently be aware about the
universities across the country that are quite well organized in terms of the location
and the whereabouts of those universities. But,the crux of the model lies in the
source of collective information that is the Data API provided by the The Indian
Government as part of the Digital India Open Data Scheme. Therefore,the user gets
the most authentic information from a credible source which would result into
transparency and an unbiased outlook which would help the user to make an
appropriate decision be it for the user itself or for friends or family. So,The Data that
the government has provided makes the most out of it.

To implement the above proposed model, We present an Android Application which
fetches the dataset from the above mentioned API and extracts signifcant content
out of it. Also, A Web Application Developed Using the LAMP stack is in the works.
